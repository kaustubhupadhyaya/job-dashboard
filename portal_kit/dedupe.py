"""Never apply twice to the same opening, whichever tool found it (lifted out of ats_apply.py on 2026-10-14, plan section 3.1).

Two jobs are the same role when their titles read the same once normalised (lower case, letters and digits only) and their
company names share a distinctive word of three letters or more. Plurals are folded on both sides first ("companies" is read as
"company", "holdings" as "holding"; words of 5+ letters only). Legal forms (LLC, Pvt Ltd, FZCO: STOP_COMPANY_WORDS), words that only
describe a firm (services, solutions, Dubai, Emirates, India ...: GENERIC_COMPANY_WORDS) and placeholders (Confidential, Client,
Stealth Startup: PLACEHOLDER_COMPANY_WORDS) do not count. A name made only of generic words is compared whole, so the same name
written twice is one role while two firms that share only "Services" are not; a name made only of placeholder and legal words matches
nothing. A repost under a new job id, or the same opening reached through another tool, is therefore one role.

Sources, all read-only and best effort (a store that is missing or unreadable adds nothing):
  - every applier database in job-tracker\\state (*.db with an `applications` table): rows with decision 'applied';
  - the LinkedIn UAE pass's job log (FORKED_Auto_job_applier_linkedIn\\logs\\linkedin_uae_jobs.jsonl): live 'applied' rows;
  - state\\manual_applications.csv: applications the user made by hand. He appends one line each: company,title,date.

    python portal_kit\\dedupe.py check [--grep TEXT]           every source, and every role logged under more than one job id
    python portal_kit\\dedupe.py check --company C --title T   would this job be skipped as a duplicate, and of what

`check` only reads. The one thing it writes is the manual list's header line, when that file does not exist yet.
